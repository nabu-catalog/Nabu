This report validates that the Sydney bucket is fully synced with the Melbourne bucket.

## Files in Sydney but not Melbourne

<% @prod_only.each do |file| -%>
  = <%= file %>
<% end -%>

## Files in Melbourne but not Sydney

<% @dr_only.each do |file| -%>
  = <%= file %>
<% end -%>

NOTE: It is normal to see a handful of files here as this report is based of an inventory of Sydney and Melbourne created by AWS at different times.
you shouldn't see this list grow though or the same files week to week
